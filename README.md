# Sample Applications for Camvi SDK Developers

There are four sample applications here:

1. bulk-import - a java application that imports image files to Camvi's database.
2. recognize-person - a python program that recognizes a person based on an image file.
3. message-queue - a C++ application that reads messages from Camvi's engine and prints them out.
4. notifier - a python program that sends out notifications (texts and emails) based on messages from the engine.
